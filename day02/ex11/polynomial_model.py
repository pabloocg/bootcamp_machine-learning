    Add polynomial features to vector x by raising its values up to the power given in
    argument.
    Args:
    x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
    power: has to be an int, the power up to which the components of vector x are going to be
    raised.
    Returns:
    The matrix of polynomial features as a numpy.ndarray, of dimension m * n, containg he
    polynomial feature values for all training examples.
    None if x is an empty numpy.ndarray.
    Raises:
    This function should not raise any Exception.
